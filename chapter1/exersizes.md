## Chapter 1 Exercises

1. How would you define Machine Learning?
   - Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so.
1. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
   - Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules. The existing solutions can be a pain to maintain when new data necessitates new rules.
1. What is a labeled training set?
1. What are the two most commo supervised tasks?
1. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
1. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
1. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
1. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
1. What is an online learning system?
1. What is out-of-core learning?
1. What type of learning algorithm, relies on similarity measure to make prediction?
1. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm hyperparameter?
1. What do model-based learning algorithms?
1. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?
1. If your model performs great on the training data but generalixes poorly to new instances,w hat is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?
1. What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?
1. What is the purpose of a validation set?
1. What is a train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?
1. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameter using the test set?
